# IF Rudyard Kipling #
## If you can keep your head when all about you 
### Are losing theirs and blaming it in you 
*If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you*
> But make allowance for their doubting too
> > If you can wait and not be tired by waiting 
> > > *Or being lied about, don't deal in lies*
+ Or being hated, dont give way to hating 
+ And yet don't look too good nor talk too wise 

If you can dream and not make dreams your master 
---
If you can think and not make thoughs your aim 
If you can meet with *Triumph* and **Disaster**
